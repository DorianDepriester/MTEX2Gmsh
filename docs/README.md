# Purpose of this toolbox
In order to evaluate the thermo-mechanical behaviour of crystalline materials (such as metals or ceramics) at microscopic scale, one usually perform numerical simulation at grain scale using the Finite Element Method. In order to proceed, one must first create a mesh which is representative of the real material.

The microstructure of cytalline materials is usually made from Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique. Thus, this toolbox is designed to generate meshes from EBSD in a robust and accurate way.
