abstract = "An open-source parallel 3-D crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) software package PRISMS-Plasticity is presented here as a part of PRISMS integrated framework. A highly efficient rate-independent crystal plasticity algorithm is implemented along with developing its algorithmic tangent modulus. Additionally, a twin activation mechanism is incorporated into the framework based on an integration point sensitive scheme. The integration of the software as a part of the PRISMS framework is demonstrated. To do so, the integration of the PRISMS-Plasticity software with experimental characterization techniques such as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction using available open source software packages of DREAM.3D and Neper is elaborated. The integration of the PRISMS-Plasticity software with the information repository of Materials Commons is also presented. The parallel performance of the software is characterized which demonstrates that it scales well for large problems running on hundreds of processors. Various examples of polycrystalline metals with face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystals structures are presented to show the capability of the software to efficiently solve crystal plasticity boundary value problems, in addition to integration with preprocessing and postprocessing tools. PRISMS-Plasticity is an important activity within the broader PRISMS Center and future enhancements to PRISMS-Plasticity are planned and will be described."
