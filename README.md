# MTEX2Gmsh
This toolbox for Matlab allows to generate meshes from EBSD data. It is intended to perform Finite Element Analysis (FEA) at grain scale on polycrystal imaged by EBSD. It is based on [MTEX](http://mtex-toolbox.github.io/) and [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/).

## Usage
The file named [Example.m](https://github.com/DorianDepriester/mtex2Gmsh/blob/master/Example.m) provides a minimum working example of the usage of the gmshGeo class. For further informations, please look at [the Wiki](https://github.com/DorianDepriester/mtex2Gmsh/wiki).
